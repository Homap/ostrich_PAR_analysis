### Overview

This document contains the analyses steps to reproduce the analyses 
including criteria to filter the VCF files, calculate genetic diversity (pi and theta) and 
folded site frequency spectrum in genomic categories: intergenic, intronic and CDS (0fold and 4fold) and DFE-alpha, 
calculates linkage disequilibrium (LD), population scaled recombination rate (rho) and PSMC.

### Abstract 

The evolutionary dynamics of pseudoautosomal regions is determined by genome-wide processes affecting effective population size and mutation rate. Moreover, patterns of molecular evolution in the PAR may also be influenced by their linkage to the sex determining region (SDR). Due to the sex-linked inheritance of PAR loci in the proximity of the SDR, expected time to coalescence is likely elevated between the sex chromosomes in this region. In this study, we used whole genome re-sequencing of south African ostrich to investigate levels and patterns of genetic diversity along the long PAR of ostrich, particularly in relation to the distance to the SDR. The mean pairwise nucleotide diversity in the PAR was 0.00165 and was similar to autosome. We observed a heterogeneous pattern of genetic diversity along the Z chromosome which could be largely explained by variation in GC content and recombination rate. Consistent with the difference in sex averaged recombination rate, linkage between SNPs was weaker in the PAR (r2 = 0.13) than the non-PAR segment of the Z chromosome (r2 = 0.17). We did not find a significant level of linkage disequilibrium across the PAR boundary, indicating recombination allows the boundary-proximal region of PAR to behave independently of SDR. Coalescent simulation confirmed this result and revealed that levels of genetic diversity and male-female differentiation are largely consistent with neutral expectations.
