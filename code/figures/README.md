# Scripts for the plots presented in the paper

Plots 2 to 4 and the supplementary plots S1 and S2 can be produced by running
the script:

`bash figures.sh` <br>

For figure 1, run the script in Rstudio and produce the two plots separately. 
Using inkscape, you can assemble the two plots as figure 1.
