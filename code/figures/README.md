# Scripts for the plots presented in the paper

Plots 2 to 4 and the supplementary plots S1 and S2 can be produced by running
the script:

`bash figures.sh` <br>

For figure 1, run the script `intro_figure.R` in Rstudio and produce the two plots separately. 
Using inkscape, you can assemble the two plots as figure 1.

The directory also contains **Z_mRNA_chro_coordinates.txt** used for gene coordinates
plotted in Figure 1.
